# 📊 **Analysis of the Current Results vs Project Needs**

Your **project goal** (as I understood from earlier conversations) is:

> To build a reliable, data-driven eBPF program compatibility matrix across multiple Linux kernels, identify which kernels are best suited for deployment, and detect potential verifier/feature incompatibilities for AI-assisted tooling.

### 🔍 What the data shows:

| Kernel | Success Rate | Notes                                     |
| ------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| 4.18   | \~23%        | Expected: very old, no BTF/CO-RE support  |
| 5.4    | 100%         | Great stability, first LTS with BTF/CO-RE |
| 5.15   | \~6.9%       | Known verifier regressions                |
| 6.1    | 100%         | Excellent: modern, LTS                    |
| 6.8    | 100%         | Excellent: most recent                    |

### ✅ *Meets Needs?*

* You can now clearly **recommend kernels 5.4, 6.1, and 6.8** for best compatibility.
* You can use the collected `.json` data as a knowledge base for AI agents to understand per-program issues and suggest fixes.
* The analyzer’s ability to compile with correct kernel headers is crucial for realistic verification.

# eBPF-MCP Docs: Multi-Kernel Analyzer

This project collects, analyzes, and reports compatibility of eBPF programs across multiple Linux kernel versions.
It helps identify which kernels provide the best support for modern eBPF features like BTF and CO-RE.

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 📦 Prerequisites

* Python ≥3.8
* Clang/LLVM (with BPF target)
* `bpftool`
* Git
* A Linux host with `/sys/fs/bpf` mounted.

### 🔄 Collect kernel sources & programs

Run the collector to clone the kernels and extract programs:

```bash
python3 -m pipeline.multi_kernel
```

This will:
✅ Clone Linux sources (only if missing)
✅ Extract `samples/bpf/*.c` from each supported kernel
✅ Parse and save JSON metadata into `data/kernel-<version>/programs/*.json`

---

### 🧪 Run the Analyzer

Run the analyzer to evaluate program compatibility per kernel:

```bash
python3 -m analysis.enhanced_analyzer
```

This will:
✅ Read the `programs/*.json`
✅ Attempt recompilation using the matching kernel headers
✅ Check verifier logs and parse errors
✅ Produce:

* Detailed per-program JSON results
* `data/detailed_compatibility_report.json`
* Summary & recommendations printed to console

---

## 📈 Output

* `data/kernel-<version>/programs/*.json`: per-program metadata
* `data/detailed_compatibility_report.json`: full report
* `data/compatibility_matrix.json`: (optional) success matrix

---

## 💡 Recommendations

* Deploy on kernels: **5.4, 6.1, or 6.8** (best compatibility)
* Avoid 4.18 and 5.15 for CO-RE/BTF programs

---

## 🧹 Cleanup

To remove downloaded sources and data:

```bash
rm -rf sources/ data/
```

---

If you’d like I can also:
✅ Write a `Makefile` with `make collect`, `make analyze`, `make clean`
✅ Add a CLI wrapper script (`bin/ebpf-mcp-analyze`)
✅ Generate an HTML/CSV summary report for sharing

Just say the word! 🚀
